## 🚀 Why This Series?

Most AI tutorials:
- ❌ Require OpenAI API keys (cost money)
- ❌ Hide the model behind an API
- ❌ Don’t teach local, private, or production-ready patterns

This series:
- ✅ Uses **free, local models** (e.g., TinyLlama, Phi-2)
- ✅ Runs on **free Google Colab GPU**
- ✅ Teaches **real LangChain patterns** (memory, agents, RAG)
- ✅ Keeps your data **private and secure**
- ✅ Builds toward **real-world AI apps**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – For chaining prompts, memory, and tools
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – To load and run local LLMs
- **Google Colab** – Free GPU-powered environment
- **TinyLlama / Phi-2 / Zephyr** – Small, fast, open-source models
- **No API Keys** – Everything runs locally in your session

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open any notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Run the cells (Runtime → Run All)
3. Interact with your AI
4. Modify prompts and experiment!

> 💡 Tip: Change runtime to **GPU** (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU) for faster inference.
